                    New Instrument Types
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    ‣ The Supersaw from Beepbox V4.2! <br>
                    An instrument type that uses many sawtooth/pulse width waves that shift in frequency using adjustable chorus-like settings. <br>
                    Comes with modulators for each of its settings. <br>
                    Fun fact: Midbox was the first mod other than Jummbox to port the supersaw to Jummbox. <br>
                    <br>
                    ‣ The Advanced FM from Goldbox! <br>
                    This instrument is a more complex counterpart to the regular FM, using 6 operators instead of 4, and allowing algorithms/feedbacks to be fully customizable. <br>
                    Comes with a few extra modulators and envelopes for it's new sliders. <br>
                    <br>
                    ‣ The Wavetable! <br>
                    An instrument type that one-ups Sandbox's duty cycle instrument type. It uses 32 custom chips in a cycle where they swap through each other with adjustable speed. <br>
                    Comes with 2 modulators to control the speed and set the current wave of the cycle. <br>
                    The wavetable also has an interpolation checkbox underneath its speed slider that allows the waves to smoothly transition between eachother, as well as two more checkboxes for if the wavetable should reset the cycle per note, and if so, the other for making the cycle end at the final wave.
                </h3>
                <h2>
                    New Effects
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    ‣ The Percussion effect! <br>
                    An effect for preventing percussive instruments from changing pitch to song-wide pitch changes. These are: Song Key, Song Key Octave, and Song Detune Modulation. <br>
                    <br>
                    ‣ The Wavefold effect! <br>
                    An effect for making an instrument's waveform invert direction when hitting certain boundaries.
                </h3>
                <h2>
                    Effects | Chord Type
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    ‣ Added the strum speed slider, as well as its modulator. <br>
                    <br>
                    ‣ Added 'arpeggio patterns' for arpeggio chords. <br>
                    It is a built-in pattern system which the arpeggio will use to cycle through notes with in an arpeggio chord.
                </h3>
                <h2>
                    Effects | Transition Type
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    ‣ Added the slide speed slider, as well as its modulator. <br>
                    <br>
                    ‣ Added a checkbox that toggles whether a seamless transition is cut off at the end of a pattern.
                </h3>
                <h2>
                    Keybinds
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    ‣ Added 5 keybinds. <br>
                    These keybinds are B, X, `, CTRL+CLICK, and CTRL+R. <br>
                    The X keybind 'cuts' the pattern, removing all notes from it while also copying them. The B keybind now activates a temporary loop bar mode, while the 'beats per bar' prompt keybind was moved to 'SHIFT+B'. The ` keybind opens the 'song recovery' prompt, holding CTRL and drag clicking on an filter/slider will record the value to a modulator as the song plays, and CTRL+R takes you to the new random generation settings prompt. <br>
                    <br>
                    ‣ Finished the ~ (SHIFT+`) keybind for starting a new blank song. <br>
                    <br>
                    ‣ Added a prompt in the preferences menu that allows toggling keybinds on/off called 'Keybind Setup...'. <br>
                </h3>
                <h2>
                    Unisons
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    ‣ Added unison compatibility to the pulse width, spectrum, and noise instrument/drum types. <br>
                    <br>
                    ‣ Added 2 unisons. <br>
                    They are Bent and Hecking Gosh (Goldbox).
                </h3>
                <h2>
                    Chipwaves
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    ‣ Added 6 chipwaves. <br>
                    These chipwaves are Accurate Sine, Accurate Triangle, Accurate Trapezoid, Secant, Trapezoid (Goldbox), and Glitch 2.
                </h3>
                <h2>
                    Envelopes
                </h2>
                <h3>

                    The Linear, Rise, and Wibble envelopes were ported from Goldbox. Jummbox Blip was ported from Jummbox V2.6. Decelerate, Stairs, and Looped Stairs are unique envelopes to Midbox. <br>

                    These settings are envelope speed (affects all envelopes on the instrument) and discrete envelopes (makes envelopes sound harsher). <br>
                    <br>
                    ‣ Renamed the 'Slow Swell' envelope to 'Swell 5'.

                    There are 4 tools/modes; Cursor, Line, Curve, and Selection. <br>- Cursor is the default draw mode where you click to place a box representing one of the custom chip's samples. <br>- The line tool draws a straight line from where you first clicked to where you release it. <br>- The curve tool first draws a line on the first drag click, and then on the second drag click, bends that line based on the mouse position. <br>- The selection tool creates a box, which you can drag and use keybinds in to change a specified part of the custom chip. <br>
                    ‣ Added the load preset button into the custom chip prompt. <br>
                    <br>
